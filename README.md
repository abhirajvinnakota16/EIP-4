1. Convolution - It’s the process of a kernel/filter traversing a particular layer in a network (like a duster erasing the board)
2. Filters/Kernels - They are those which convolve an image/channel and give out an output channel which is filtered for a specific information.
3. Epochs - One epoch is one iteration of the learning algorithm using us the entire training data.
4. 1x1 convolution - These are kernels/filters used to compress the channels of the input layer into lesser number of channels in the output layer.
5. 3x3 convolution - These are the standard kernals/filters used while building layers in the network that convolve over an input layer and give an output layer, filtering for specific information.
6. Feature Maps - It’s a collection of the same feature mapped together. 
7. Activation Function - It’s a function that introduces non-linearity into the model, such as maximizing small differences between numbers etc. 
8. Receptive Field -  The amount of information that a particular pixel in the final output layer has learned of the first input layer is its receptive field. If the there are no intermediate layers then that can also be called as the local receptive field.
